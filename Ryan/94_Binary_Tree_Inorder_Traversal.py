# Solution 2 - Morris Traversal - first version
# current pointer starts from root, if current.left exist, do rotation
# How to rotation?
# A:use current.left_subtree to replace current, and paste the current amd its right subtree to the rightmost node.right of the original curremt.left_subtree
# if current.left not exist, current = current.right, check again.
# keep doing the check until the whole nodes only have right child
# time:O(n), Intuitively, the complexity is O(nlogn), because to
#      find the predecessor node for a single node related to the
#      height of the tree. But in fact, finding the predecessor nodes 
#      for all nodes only needs O(n) time. Because a binary Tree 
#      with n nodes has n-1 edges, the whole processing for each 
#      edges up to 2 times, one is to locate a node, and the other is to 
#      find the predecessor node. So the complexity is O(n)O(n).
